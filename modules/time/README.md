## Notes

Version 0.1 of this library is no longer actively maintained.
A 0.2 version will be released in the future, which will contain a number of breaking changes.

If you need additional functionality that this crate does not provide, check out the [`chrono`](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) crate.

## Usage

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
time = "0.1"
```

And this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate time;
```
