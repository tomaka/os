//! OHCI initialization.
//!
//! Initializes an OCHI implementation.
//!
//! Because of legacy compatibility, the OHCI can be in three possible states when the operating
//! system starts:
//!
//! - Used by the System Management Mode driver (SMM). The SMM driver is one of the first
//! components that starts at system initialization, and redirects the legacy PS/2 I/O ports to
//! the USB controller. If the SMM driver has ownership of the OHCI controller, the
//! `InterruptRouting` bit is set in the `HcControl` register.
//!
//! - Used by the BIOS, or by a previous operating system driver. If the BIOS has ownership of the
//! OCHI controller, the `InterruptRouting` bit is not set and the `HostControllerFunctionalState`
//! is not `UsbReset`.
//!
//! - Not powered up. The `InterruptRouting` bit is not set and `HostControllerFunctionalState` is
//! `UsbReset`.
//!
//! See also section 5.1.1.3 of the specs.
//!
//! This module performs a software reset and switches the OHCI controller to the "suspended"
//! state, after which it pass control to another part of the code.
