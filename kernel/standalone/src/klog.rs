//! Kernel logs handling.
//!
//! This module handles the way the kernel prints logs. It provides the [`KLogger`] structure
//! that needs to be configured with a certain logging output method, and is then capable of
//! outputting logs.
//!
//! # Panic-free code
//!
//! The code within this module is designed to be as panic-free as possible. In other words, you
//! can assume that a [`KLogger`] will be capable of printing a panic message without itself
//! triggering a nested panic.
//!
//! In particular, none of the code within this module does any heap allocation. Note that APIs
//! that use a [`KLogger`] typically wrap it within an `Arc`. In order to account for possible
//! allocation errors during the allocation of this `Arc`, one is encouraged to create a default
//! fallback [`KLogger`] (using the const [`KLogger::new`] method) in order to print potential
//! panic messages before the actual [`KLogger`] is properly set up.
