//! Platform-specific code and kernel entry point.
//!
//! This module contains all the platform-specific code of the stand-alone kernel, plus the entry
//! point and initialization code.
//!
//! Initialization includes:
//!
//! - Initializing all CPU cores.
//! - Setting up a stack for each CPU core.
//! - Setting up the memory allocator in the [`mem_alloc`](crate::mem_alloc) module.
//! - Setting up a panic handler.
//!
//! After everything has been initialized, the entry point creates a struct that implements the
//! [`PlatformSpecific`] trait, and initializes and runs a [`Kernel`](crate::kernel::Kernel).
