//! Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT)
//!
//! The PIT is a chip that allows raising an Interrupt ReQuest (IRQ) after a certain time has
//! elapsed. This IRQ is propagated to [the I/O APIC], which then delivers an interrupt to one
//! or more processors.
//!
//! In order to determine which IRQ is raised, one need to look at the interrupt source overrides
//! of the ACPI tables for an entry corresponding to ISA IRQ 0.
//!
//! # About performances
//!
//! The implementation below is very inefficient and very restrictive. The PIT in general
//! should only be used in limited circumstances and not under regular load.
//!
