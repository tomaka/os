//! # Caching
//!
//! There exists six ways a CPU can treat memory, w.r.t. caching:
//!
//! - Strong Uncachable (UC). Memory is not cached. All operations are ordered.
//! - Uncachable (UC-). Used in conjunction with the (Page Attributes Table) PAT, which we don't
//! support.
//! - Write Combining (WC). Memory is not cached. Writes might be reordered and multiple writes 
//! might be combined into one.
//! - Write Through (WT). Memory is cached. Writes update the cache entry (if any) and are also
//! propagated to the physical memory and may be combined (as with WC).
//! - Write Protected (WP). Similar to WT, but writes also invalidate the corresponding cache lines
//! on all other processors.
//! - Write Back (WB). Memory is cached. Writes only update the cache entry, and the physical
//! memory is updated only when the cache line is flushed (such as when the cache is full).
