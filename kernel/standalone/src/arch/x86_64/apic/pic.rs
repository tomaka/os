/// Remap and disable the PIC.
///
/// The PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) is the old chip responsible for triggering
/// on the CPU interrupts coming from the hardware.
///
/// Because of poor design decisions, it will by default trigger interrupts 0 to 15 on the CPU,
/// which are normally reserved for software-related concerns. For example, the timer will by
/// default trigger interrupt 8, which is also the double fault exception handler.
///
/// In order to solve this issue, one has to reconfigure the PIC in order to make it trigger
/// interrupts between 32 and 47 rather than 0 to 15.
///
/// Note that this code disables the PIC altogether. Despite the PIC being disabled, it is
/// still possible to receive spurious interrupts. Hence the remapping.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is not thread-safe. It must only be called once simultaneously and while nothing
/// else is accessing the PIC.
