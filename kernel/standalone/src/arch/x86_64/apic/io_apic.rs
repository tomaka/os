//! I/O APIC management.
//!
//! When a piece of hardware (for example a PCI device) wants to notify the CPU of something,
//! it emits an **IRQ** (Interrupt ReQuest). IRQs have a number associated for identification.
//!
//! For example: if a machine has a network device and a sound device, the network device can be
//! configured to emit an IRQ 3 when a network packet arrive, while a sound device can be
//! configured to emit an IRQ 5 when the sound buffer has space for a new frame. When an IRQ 3 is
//! received, we know that it is because the network device has received a network packet.
//!
//! When an IRQ is emitted, it is received by an **I/O APIC**, which is what this module is about.
//! If the I/O APIC has been configured as such, it will then in turn emit an interrupt with the
//! chosen number on the chosen CPU.
//!
//! We are totally free to associate any interrupt number and CPU we want to an IRQ. It is also
//! possible for multiple IRQs to be configured to produce an identical interrupt.
//! Keep in mind that the CPU has no way to know what is the source of an interrupt. In
//! particular, a CPU can't know if an interrupt comes from an IRQ or which IRQ.
//!
//! A machine is often composed of multiple I/O APICs, each dedicated to a different range of
//! IRQs. See also the [../io_apics] module.

// # Implementation notes.

// Reference document for the I/O APIC:

//
// The I/O APIC exposes two memory-mapped registers: one selector, and one window.
// One must write a register number in the selector, then the value of the register is accessible
// through the window.
