//! Interrupts management.
//!
//! When an interrupt happens on an ARM platform, the CPU automatically sets the PC register
//! (Program Counter) to a certain value depending on the interrupt. For example, executing
//! an illegal instruction makes the CPU jump to the address 0x4. The CPU then continues
//! execution at this location.
//!
//! In order to properly handle interrupts, we write the memory locations where the CPU can
//! potentially jump to with branching instructions.
