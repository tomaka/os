//! Collection of commands that can build a kernel.
//!
//! # Kernel environment
//!
//! This crate doesn't contain the source code of the kernel. Instead, many of the commands require
//! you to pass the location of a `Cargo.toml` that will build this kernel.
//!
//! This crate, however, is responsible for building bootable images and setting up the boot
//! process on various targets. It therefore sets up an environment that the kernel can expect
//! to be there.
//!
//! This environment is the following:
//!
//! - The kernel must provide a symbol named `_start`. Execution will jump to this symbol, after
//! which the kernel is in total control of the hardware.
//! - The kernel cannot make any assumption about the state of the registers, memory, or hardware
//! when `_start` is executed, with some exceptions depending on the target.
//! - The symbols `__bss_start` and `__bss_end` exist and correspond to the beginning and end
//! of the BSS section (see below).
//!
//! ## BSS section
//!
//! The BSS section is the section, in an ELF binary, where all the static variables whose initial
//! value is all zeroes are located.
//!
//! Normally, it is the role of the ELF loader (e.g. the Linux kernel) to ensure that this section
//! is initialized with zeroes. Operating systems, however, are generally not loaded by an ELF
//! loader.
//!
//! Consequently, when the kernel starts, it **must** write the memory between the `__bss_start`
//! and `__bss_end` symbols with all zeroes.
//!
//! This can be done like this:
//!
//! ```norun
//! let mut ptr = __bss_start;
//! while ptr < __bss_end {
//!     ptr.write_volatile(0);
//!     ptr = ptr.add(1);
//! }
//!
//! extern "C" {
//!     static mut __bss_start: *mut u8;
//!     static mut __bss_end: *mut u8;
//! }
//! ```
