//! Bindings for interfacing with the environment of the "kernel".
//!
//! # Messages and responses
//!
//! The environment available to `redshirt` programs consists in a collection of **interfaces**.
//! An interface is referred to by a 32-bytes hash.
//!
//! Programs can emit messages by passing a target interface (a 32 bytes array), and a buffer
//! containing the body of the message. The way the body of the message must be interpreted is
//! entirely dependant on the interface it is sent on. Emitting a message always succeeds if the
//! interface is available to the program, even if the body is malformed.
//!
//! When emitting a message, the sender must indicate whether or not it expects a response. If the
//! interface handler sends back a response when none is expected, the response is discarded. If
//! the interface handler doesn't send back a response when one is expected, then you effectively
//! have a memory leak.
//!
//! A response can also be cancelled by the sender, in which case it is as if it had decided to not
//! expect any response.
//!
//! The two primary and recommended ways to emit a message are the
//! [`emit_message_without_response`] and [`emit_message_with_response`] functions.
//!
//! # Interface handling
//!
//! If your program is registered as an interface handler (using the `interface` interface, not
//! covered here), then it can receive interface messages using the [`next_interface_message`]
//! function.
//!
//! The message can later be optionally be answered using the [`emit_answer`] function. If the
//! mesage is malformed, you can also use the [`emit_message_error`] function.
//!
//! There is no way for an interface handler to pro-actively send data to a process. Communication
//! can only be done as a response to a message. This must be taken into account when designing
//! interfaces.
//!
//! # About threads
//!
//! Multithreading in WASM isn't specified yet, and Rust doesn't allow multithreaded WASM code.
//! In particular, multithreaded WASM code in LLVM is undefined behaviour.
//!
//! With that in mind, this makes writing an implementation of `Future` challenging. When the
//! `Future` returns `Poll::Pending`, the `Waker` has to be stored somewhere and invoked. Since
//! there is no possibility of having multiple threads, the only moment when the `Waker` can be
//! invoked is when we explicitly call a function whose role is to do that. The only reasonable
//! choice for such function is the [`block_on`] function, or similar functions.
//!
//! For the same reason, it is also challenging to write an implementation of [`block_on`].
//! Putting the current thread to sleep is not enough, because the lack of background threads
//! makes it impossible for the `Waker` to be invoked. An implementation of [`block_on`] **must**
//! somehow perform actions that will drive to completion the `Future` it is blocking upon,
//! otherwise nothing will ever happen.
//!
//! Consequently, it has been decided that the implementations of `Future` that this module
//! provide interact, through a global variable, with the behaviour of [`block_on`]. More
//! precisely, before a `Future` returns `Poll::Pending`, it stores its `Waker` in a global
//! variable alongside with the ID of the message whose response we are waiting for, and the
//! [`block_on`] function reads and processes that global variable.
//!
//! It is not possible to build a `Future` that is not built on top of one of the `Future`
//! provided by this crate, and every single use-cases of `Future`s that we could think of
//! can and must be built on top of them. Similarly, it is not possible to build an implementation
//! of [`block_on`] without having access to the internals of these `Future`s. Tying these
//! `Future`s to the implementation of [`block_on`] is therefore the logical thing to do.
//!
